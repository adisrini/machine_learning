# Machine Learning Exploration
##### A handful of projects exploring different facets of machine learning.

**1. Titanic Survival Exploration**

In this project, I examined a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, including features such as age, gender, cabin class, familial passengership, and more. These features were used to classify survival outcome. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used as a predictor for danger and can be used to generate insight for taking preventative actions. The algorithm used was iterated several times to improve the accuracy, and the final estimator was accurate 80.13% of the time. This project highlights introductory concepts in machine learning such as evaluation metrics and feature selection.

**2. Predicting Housing Prices in the Boston Market**

This project illustrates a useful application of machine learning in the field of real estate. Housing markets are very competitive, especially in popular areas such as Boston. I used a dataset containing information about housing in the Boston market, including features such as crime rate, nitrous oxide concentration, and proximity to important infrastructure, to predict housing value. I developed an model using the parameters provided to best fit the training data points, and then evaluated its strength on testing data. The model was optimized through the use of cross-validation and grid search algorithms to determine the optimal parameter set for estimation. I also analyzed the model using graphs of learning curves and model complexity to determine the best model to use from a generated set.
